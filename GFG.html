        <h2>Project Overview:</h2>
        <p>The USB Physical Security System is designed to enhance the security of computer systems by controlling access to USB ports. This project provides a mechanism to block or unblock USB ports, thereby preventing unauthorized use of USB devices. The system is particularly useful in environments where data security is paramount, such as corporate offices, educational institutions, and government agencies.</p>
