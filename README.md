USB Physical Security Project

It is a GUI application used for secure the usb port of a system to encrypt or decrypt the usb port when the user required to protect the system from any attacks and for privacy protection.

USB ports are essential for connecting external devices, but they can also 
pose security risks. Unauthorized USB devices can introduce malware or 
steal sensitive data. In this project, we develop an application that 
provides security for USB ports, allowing users to control their system’s 
USB connectivity. 
The USB Physical Security System is designed to enhance the security of 
computer systems by controlling access to USB ports. This project 
provides a mechanism to block or unblock USB ports, thereby 
preventing unauthorized use of USB devices. The system is particularly 
useful in environments where data security is paramount, such as 
corporate offices, educational institutions, and government agencies. 


Why Use USB Physical Security Applications? 
A. Data Protection: 
o USB physical security applications safeguard sensitive data 
stored on USB drives. 
o These tools prevent unauthorized access, ensuring that only 
authorized users can interact with the data. 
B. Malware Prevention: 
o USB drives are notorious carriers of malware. 
o Security applications help prevent malware spread through 
infected USB drives, protecting both individual systems and 
entire networks. 
C. Phishing Mitigation: 
o USB security keys provide robust two-factor authentication 
(2FA). 
D. Physical Security Enhancement: 
o USB security keys act as exclusive access points. 
o No one can access your data unless they have both your 
password and the physical security key. 
E. Compliance and Auditing: 
o Organizations can enforce USB security policies to comply with 
industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). 
o Security applications maintain audit trails, allowing 
organizations to track USB-related events. 


Features and Functionality :
1. USB Port Locking Mechanism 
• Users can enable or disable USB ports with a single click. 
• The application communicates directly with the operating system to 
control port access. 
• This feature ensures that only authorized users can use USB devices 
on the system. 
2. Password Protection 
• To prevent unauthorized changes to USB port settings, the 
application requires users to enter a password. 
• Users must authenticate themselves before modifying any USB
related configurations. 
• Password protection adds an extra layer of security to the 
application. 
3. Log/Events 
• The application maintains an events log. 
• When a user logs into the application, the timestamp is recorded. 
• Additionally, failed login attempts (wrong passwords) are also 
logged. 
• Users can view a chronological list of all login events and incorrect 
attempts. 
4. User Interface (UI) 
• The UI provides an intuitive and user-friendly experience. 
• Key components include: 
o Status Indicators: Show whether USB ports are currently 
enabled or disabled. 
o Toggle Buttons: Allow users to switch USB port access on or off. 
o Device List: Displays connected USB devices. 
o Notifications: Users receive real-time notifications when a USB 
device is connected or disconnected.


Conclusion :
Our USB physical security system provides a reliable defense against 
unauthorized access and data breaches. By combining usability and robust 
features, we enhance overall security in an interconnected world. This 
report synthesizes research, design, and testing efforts, ensuring a 
comprehensive understanding of USB physical security systems. 
Our USB physical security application provides a practical solution for 
controlling USB port access. By implementing this project, we contribute to 
overall system security and user convenience.
